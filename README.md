# StingerHost public bug and issue reports and roadmap plans

In this repository, we publish some of our roadmap plans for our hosting services. Development and improvements of our existing services, and perhaps plans to add new services in the near future. Everything can be found in the [Public Issues and Plans for Stingerhost Project](https://github.com/orgs/Stingerhost/projects/2 "Public Issues and Plans for Stingerhost Project").

## Bug/issue reports, and feature requests

To report a bug or other issue, or to request a feature, head over to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Stingerhost/public-issues-and-plans/issues "Click here to browse issues") and submit a new issue. Our developers will take a look at your submission and decide on further development. We will ask you for additional details if we need them, so please keep your issues open and make sure you're watching them.

Make sure to first search in existing issues to avoid making duplicates. Duplicate issues are going to be closed.
